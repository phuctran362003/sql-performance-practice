# SQL Performance Practice

## Overview
Welcome to the **SQL Performance Practice** repository! This repository is dedicated to helping developers and database administrators (DBAs) learn and implement best practices for optimizing SQL Server databases. It includes step-by-step tutorials, performance experiments, and practical examples to improve your understanding of database optimization techniques.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Practical use cases for creating and optimizing SQL Server databases.
- **Performance Tuning**: Experiments comparing different indexing strategies, query optimization techniques, and their impact on performance.
- **Hands-On Learning**: Sample scripts for creating databases, tables, indexes, and running queries.
- **Best Practices**: Insights into designing efficient database schemas, choosing the right indexes, and maintaining performance over time.

## What's Inside
1. **Database Design and Indexing**
   - Creating clustered and non-clustered indexes.
   - Using composite (B-Tree) indexes for complex queries.
   - Guidelines for balancing read and write performance.

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Analyzing query performance with `SET STATISTICS IO` and `SET STATISTICS TIME`.
   - Comparing execution plans to identify bottlenecks.
   - Reducing logical reads and optimizing query execution times.

3. **Advanced Topics**
   - Using composite indexes for filtering and sorting.
   - Optimizing joins and subqueries.
   - Maintaining and updating statistics for consistent performance.

4. **Example Scenarios**
   - Real-world examples of indexing for large datasets (e.g., 500,000+ rows).
   - Testing with complex filtering and ordering conditions.
   - Tuning for high-concurrency environments.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phuctran362003/sql-performance-practice.git
   cd sql-performance-practice
   ```

2. Run the scripts in your SQL Server instance to test and analyze performance improvements.

Happy Query Optimization! ðŸš€
